# Antifocus üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Antifocus


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Johan Antony Davis - College of Engineering Trivandrum

### A Chrome extension that uses AI to detect where the user is looking at the screen, and blurs that section of area.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
It happened for me to notice that website users are actually able to see the sections of the websites that they are looking at (Sounds funny, doesn't it!). No... This doesn't even sound right.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So to solve the huge problem, I came up with a massive solution. Just simply blur the contents that they are looking at üôÉ.

## Technical Details

*Multiple settings allowed too, here the camera is not visible on the screen and the gaze dot is enabled (where the user is looking)*

### Project Demo
# Video
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WnnrveVxBrR_YszpJv6XNJgN_B0W2KpX/view?usp=sharing)
The video demontrates that the AI tracks our eyes around the screen and blurs the content that the eyes are looking at. The extensions also has many customization options like camera toggle on/off, enable gaze dot to show where the AI thinks you are looking at, etc.
